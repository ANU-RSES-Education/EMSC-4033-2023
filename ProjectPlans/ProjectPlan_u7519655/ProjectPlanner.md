# The water isotope distribution of Australia

## Executive summary

The water isotopes like Oxygen or Hydrogen will change due to the change of different environment and conditions like altitude or landform. This is  a very importent element in geochemistry research. In this project, I plan to build a dashboard when someone tape in parameters like maxmum value, minimum value, or time in different scale the map will show how water isotopes distrubutes in this area. This map will conbine water isotope data with catchment map that users can acess the specific data  in one catchment they ordered. 

## Goals

There will be two goals in this project.

**First goal**: Select Australia water isotope data from world data provided by University of Utah.

**Second goal**: apply Australia catchement map to world isotope data. Build a seclect system that allow people to choose their data in some specific conditions. Also try to apply some other data like preciptation in to the map to help making comparision.

## Background and Innovation  

This project aims to use the world water isotope data that has already been generated to build a library of water isotope distribution for Australia situation. The university of Utah has already done this for every continent and divided this in every month, but I want to do this in Australia and add more parameters. The most difficult thing is to conbine catchment map and water isotope map together and make it live.

## Resources & Timeline

The resources what I want to use is: 
Isoscapes: Understanding Movement, Pattern, and Process on Earth Through Isotope Mapping(ed. West, Bowen, Dawson and Tu; Springer)
Catchment map data and preciptation data will comes from Bureau of Meteorology of Australia.


## Testing, validation, documentation

It is easy to test this code for just tapping in the parameters you need and run it, since the data comes from outside, if data comes out, this means it works. 

_Provide some specific tests with values that you can imagine `assert`ing_
