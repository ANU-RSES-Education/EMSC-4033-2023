# The USGS earthquake data apply to Australia

## Executive summary

The USGS (United States Geological Survey) has the most detialed information of the earthquake in the world, but how can we apply this to our own countries? In this project, I plan to build a dashboard when someone tape in parameters like time, maxmum magnititude, minimum magnititude, or the different states the map will show how earthquakes distrubutes in this area. This map will combine earthquake data with state map that users can acess the specific data  in one state they ordered. 

## Goals

There will be two goals in this project.

**First goal**: Select Australia earthquake data from USGS world earthquake data.

**Second goal**: apply Australia states map to earthquake data. Build a seclect system that allow people to choose their data in some specific conditions. Also try to give user ways to apply this data to their own situation.

## Background and Innovation  

This project aims to use the USGS earthquake data apply to Australia situation, which has several difficulties: how to get the earthquake data and apply it to map, how to select them by different states, and how to use this Url to get detial information of the earthquaqke.
The innovation of this project is to modify this map for most countries that people can use this for their own countries.

## Resources & Timeline

The resources what I want to use is: 
USGS earthquake data base:'https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/query'

## Testing, validation, documentation

It is easy to test this code for just tapping in the parameters you need and run it, since the data comes from outside, if data comes out, this means it works. 

_Provide some specific tests with values that you can imagine `assert`ing_
