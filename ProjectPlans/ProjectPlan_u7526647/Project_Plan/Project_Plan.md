## Waveform Pre-processing for Rare Seismic Phases

## Executive summary
Many rare seismic phases, for example PKJKP waves are difficult to observe due to their low amplitude and high noise arriving at the same time. Additionally, they can only be observed in a small observation window, at a specific epicentral distance and only for high magnitude events. To tackle these challenging observation conditions, I plan to provide an interactive tool that simplifies the pre-processing of these waves. This will be especially useful for students who do not have any experience with wave processing or are not familiar with Obspy and researchers with limited time.

## Goals
1)	Provide a list of suitable earthquake events based on the seismic stations chosen by the user.
2)	Process the waveforms using the parameters recommended by in literature or specified by the user.
3)	Display the waveforms in the appropriate time window.
4)	Create additional graphics/images (e.g., a map of the analysed earthquake events) that can be used in the presentation of results.

Additionally:
5) Prevent the user from introducing errors into the programme.
6) Provide data that can be used for more sophisticated analyses.




## Background and Innovation  
Already existing:
- Obspy: python library for seismic data acquisition and pre-processing; widely used in seismology.
- Wilber3: A service by IRIS Data Services; allows the user to download data for specific events.
- “An ObsPy library for event detection and seismic attribute calculation: preparing waveforms for automated analysis”: (https://github.com/rossjturner/seismic_attributes); processing of seismic signals for NON-earthquake sources.
- Some computer programs dedicated to the processing and analysis of seismic data (often very expensive).
- Computer programs to produce synthetic seismograms.
- All existing code is very specialised, and most research groups just develop their own programs for their research needs.


What’s new: 
- Station-based approach
- Simplicity of the program
- Interactive features
- Focus on rare seismic phases



## Resources & Timeline
**Resources**

The project will only make use of free software such as Python, Visual Studio and additional Python libraries (mainly Obspy). No extraordinary computing power is needed. Notebooks and files will likely be saved on “compute2”, a local directory or in the Jupyter Hub Cloud.
Data is acquired from servers like IRIS and USGS that provide seismological data to the public (free of charge).

**Timeline**
The project runs over the course of 4 weeks with a presentation of the algorithm on 31/05/2023.

Week 1: Familiarize with all Obspy features, initial code structure.

Week 2: Focus on input validation and data acquisition.

Week 3: Data Processing and additional features.

Week 4: Prepare presentation and testing.




## Testing, validation, documentation
As it is an interactive application, the programme will be heavily based on input validation. Testing will be limited as for most functions there will be no pre-existing values that results can be compared to. Therefore, a regular test run with pre-defined station and parameters might be a good way to check that the programma is working.
