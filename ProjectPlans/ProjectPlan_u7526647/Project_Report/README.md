Pleas read before use: 

**User_Application.ipynb** is the main project file and uses the files: 
- functions.py
- network_list.py
- network_names.json
- phase_parameters.json
- phases_list.py


**test_file.py** contains tests for the application

**Automatic_Wave_Processing.ipynb** contains additional information (as showed in the presentation in case something is unclear.)

**processes_overview.pdf** gives an overview of the processes, inputs and outputs.
