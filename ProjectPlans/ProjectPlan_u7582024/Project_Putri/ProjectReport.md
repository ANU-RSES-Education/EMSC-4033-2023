### Introduction

This project comprises three programs designed to facilitate seismic risk analysis and visualization.  

1. **`job_xml_generator.py`**

    `job_xml_generator.py` is a program designed to generate NRML data model (XML-based data) and configuration file that serve as input for `oq_calculation.py`. It accepts user input to enable customization during the file generation process, so that users can provide specific parameters, settings, or configuration details. There are four file that could be created, including `exposure_model.xml`, `fragility_model.xml`, `rupture_model.xml`, and `job.ini`.  
---
2. **`oq_calculation.py`**  

    `oq_calculation.py` is a program aimed to performs OpenQuake calculations required for ground motion modeling and probability of damage distribution. It uses input files generated from `job_xml_generator.py` and a `csv` file that has information about exposure model defined in `exposure_model.xml`.  
---
3. **`streamlit_app.py`**  

    `streamlit_app.py` is a program that offer a streamlined dashboard experience on Streamlit, allowing users to explore and interact with the outputs generated by `oq_calculation.py` alongside predefined shapefile (\*.shp) data.  

Together, these programs provide a comprehensive solution for seismic risk assessment and visualization, simplifying the process of analyzing and visualizing potential earthquake impacts.

    > ```
---
2. **Run `job_xml_generator.py`**
    - Prepare all parameters/setting that will be inputted in this program. As an sample, I prepare `sample_parameters.xlsx` in `samples` folder as an example to guide you running this program.
    - Create `data` folder.
    - Prepare `csv` file that has information about exposure model that will be defined in `exposure_model.xml`. This file should be stored in `data` folder. Information about how to create the `csv` file could be accessed in [OpenQuake_docs](https://docs.openquake.org/oq-engine/manual/latest/risk.html). As an sample, I also prepare `new_exposure_model.csv` in `samples\data` folder.
    - To run this program execute the following command in your terminal or command prompt:  
    ```bash
    python job_xml_generator.py
    ```
    - After you execute the program, a user prompt will appear where you can choose which file you want to generate first. Once you chose, there will be another prompt that asks you to fill all of the parameters. You can use parameters in `sample_parameters.xlsx` in `samples` folder here.
    - After you finish generating one file, you have to generate other files by running this program again.
    - All generated files (`exposure_model.xml`, `fragility_model.xml`, `rupture_model.xml`, and `job.ini`) will be stored in `data` folder.
    - As an sample, I have generated `exposure_model.xml`, `fragility_model.xml`, `rupture_model.xml`, and `job.ini` that could be found in `samples\data` folder.
---
3. **Run `oq_calculation.py`**
    - Input files for this program are generated from `job_xml_generator.py`.
    - Make sure that all `xml` files defined in `job.ini` has the same name with `xml` file in the folder.
    - Run this program by executing the following command:
    ``` js
    python oq_calculation.py
    ```
    - There are 5 outputs generated by this program, including `gmf_data_X.csv`,`avg_gmf_X.csv`,`damages-rlzs-000_X.csv`, `aggrisk-_X.csv`, and `risk_by_event_X.csv`, with `X` is `calculation_id`. For example, if one of your output is `avg_gmf_160.csv`, your `calculation_id` is `160`. These files are stored in `output` folder. 
    - As an sample, I have generated `gmf_data_095.csv`,`avg_gmf_095.csv`,`damages-rlzs-000_095.csv`, `aggrisk.csv`, and `risk_by_event.csv` that could be found in `samples\output` folder.

4. **Run `streamlit_app.py`**
    - Input files for this program are generated from  `job_xml_generator.py` program and predefined `shapefile` data required for spatial visualization. These data could be found in `output` and `SHP` folder, respectively.
    - To run this program, execute the following command:
    ``` js
    streamlit run streamlit_app.py -- [calculation_id]
    ```
    - As described before, `calculation_id` is id for every output from `oq_calculation.py`
    - This command will start the Streamlit server, and you can access the dashboard by opening the provided local URL in your web browser.

### Testing and Validation
#### Validation
There are several validation mechanisms to ensure the validity of user inputs. These validations are crucial to guarantee that the provided inputs adhere to the expected format and meet specific criteria. Here is a brief explanation of the validation process:
1. **Numeric Validation**: To validate numeric inputs, I check if the user-provided values are indeed numbers, whether it is `int` or `float`.If the input is not a valid number, an error message is displayed, prompting the user to provide a valid numeric value. This validation is implemented in `checkNumber()` function. 
2. **Input Range Validation**: For inputs that have specific ranges or limits, such as numerical values within a certain range, I validate whether the provided input falls within the acceptable range.This validation is also implemented in `checkNumber()` function. 
3. **String Validation**: It involves verifying that user inputs are in the expected string format. This may include checking for the presence of certain characters or validating against predefined patterns or regular expressions. This validation implemented in some function, e.g. `text_input()` function. 
---
#### Testing
In this project, **unit testing** is used to validate the functionality of the `job_xml_generator` module. There are several types of testing performed in this code:

1. **Function Testing**: Several individual functions within the `job_xml_generator` module are tested using the `unittest.TestCase` class. Each test method is named descriptively to indicate the specific function being tested. For example, `test_cost_type_pick()` tests the `cost_type_pick()` function.
2. **Input Testing**: The `unittest.mock.patch` decorator is used to simulate user input during the test cases. By patching the `builtins.input` function, you can control the inputs provided to the functions being tested. The `side_effect` parameter of patch is set to a list of input values to simulate a sequence of user inputs.
3. **Assertion Testing**: The `assertEqual()` method from the `unittest.TestCase` class is used to compare the actual results of the tested functions against the expected results. This assertion ensures that the functions produce the desired output.
4. **File Testing**: The `test_create_job_ini()` method tests the `create_job_ini()` function, which generates a `job.ini` file. This test case mocks the file writing process using builtins.open and mock_open, allowing you to capture the written content and verify if it matches the expected content.

The code for these testing is `tests.py`. To run this test, execute the following command:
```bash
python -m unittest tests
```

### Samples and Demo
Samples of the output generated from `job_xml_generator.py` and `oq_calculation.py` could be found in `samples` folder. These samples could be used to run streamlit dashboard demo. `SHP` folder that holds all shapefile needed to run the dashboard is already available. To run the demo, execute the following command:

```bash
streamlit run demo_streamlit_app.py
```
This command will start the Streamlit server, and you can access the dashboard by opening the provided local URL in your web browser. 

An example pdf-version of the streamlit dashboard generated from `demo_streamlit_app.py` can be seen in [this pdf file](./streamlit_app.pdf)
