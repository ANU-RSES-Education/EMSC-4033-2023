# Project directory for Ashley Huang (u7061118)

This project creates a new package `PDEsolver` for solving one-dimentional first-order PDEs using the pseudo-spectral method.

This directory contains the following files, and please read them in the listed order:  
`Project_plan.md`: detailed plan of the project    
`Project_report.md`: report for summarising and analysing the usage of `PDEsolver`  
`requirements.txt`: file for installing all necessary external packages  
`PDEsolver.py`: script for functions  
`Project_test.ipynb`: test functions and validations  
`Project_user.ipynb`: 7 examples of different users using `PDEsolver`  
`Project_error_evaluation.ipynb`: convergence, error, and operation speed evaluation of `PDEsolver`  
`Project_presentation.ipynb`: presentation and demonstration of the project

Please first refer to the [Presentation](Project_presentation.ipynb) (with figures) or [Report](Project_report.md) (without figures) if you wish to get an overall idea of the whole project. Note that the instructions of `PDEsolver` is in the `Project_report.md`.
