## Project Marking

For your projects we expect you to upload all your code and/or notebooks to your repository. 

Depending on the nature of the project you selected to do, it may make sense that you gather lots 
of functions and/or class definitions in a python module and then have some notebooks that demonstrate
your project's functionality to the **typical user**.

The code and the notebooks should not have comments as if you are reporting back to the class 
lecturers. Instead, the code and notebooks should be kept in the form like you, as a typical 
**user** would like to see them.

Along with your code and notebooks, we will also expect you to upload a "Project Report" in the form
of a markdown file `ProjectReport.md`. In the report you could include comments towards the class 
lecturers, e.g., discuss why functionality X was hard or impossible to implement and therefore you
chose a different approach using module `blahblah` that included functionality Y.

In summary, for your projects we expect you to upload to your repository the following items:

- Project Plan
  
  We partially did that together, but we will be expecting it to be filled up completely and updated to reflect the project you ended up doing.
  
- Project Jupyter Notebook(s) & Code

- Project Report (markdown file).

### Marking Scheme Explained

| Mark     |   What you need to do   |  Value  |
|:--:      |:---                     |:--:     |
| A        |   A complete answer, hitting all relevant points, not necessarily perfect | 100% |
| B        |   A strong answer that may miss a few things here and there               | 75 % |
| C        |   OK but not complete or missing the point at times, not misleading or wrong | 50 % |
| F        |   Incomplete or wrong                                                        | 0%   | 


### Project Submission

We would like everything to be pushed up in the Github repository by Friday, June 3rd, 11:59pm.

During the presentations (Wednesday, June 9th, 2pm-5pm) we will guide you make a tagged release of your project's code.
