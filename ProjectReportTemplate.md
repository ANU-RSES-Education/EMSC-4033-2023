## EMSC4033 - Project Report

### Instructions

Add here instructions for what the user need to do to use your code. List any dependencies and/or input files that might be needed or include instructrions for how the user can use, e.g., a custom conda environment that you may have included with your code.

### List of dependencies + short description

(for example)

- **numpy**: a package to create and manipulate n-dimensional arrays
- **package_blah_blah*: ...


### Testing

Give a short description of the tests and or input validations you have included in your code

### Limitations

Describes the limitations of your code. E.g., it only works with netCDF files because of this package that is used cannot read anything else. Any other limitations also in what users cannot do with this code. Or other things that you feel you could have done better?

### Future Improvements	

Talk a bit about how you or somebody could take this code to the next level. How is the code generalizable to solve more general problems?
